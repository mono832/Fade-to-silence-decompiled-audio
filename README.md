This is a project that took me about two weeks to finish.

I decompiled the game and gathered all the bits of audio that i could, then individually converted a few thousand to be actually readable.

This audio is the property of Black Forest Games \& THQ Nordic. If they have any issues with this please just give me a friendly message and i will private this. (I know its pretty shady to snatch game audio like this but i wanted to preserve it, and also to see what fun bits of dialogue were left out)



VGM steam, was used to convert alot of the audio
