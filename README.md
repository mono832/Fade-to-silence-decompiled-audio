This is a project that took me about two weeks to fninish.

I decompiled the game and gathered all the bits of audio that i could, then individually converted a few thousand to be actually readable.

This audio is the property of Black Forest Games & THQ Nordic. If they have any issues with this please just give me a friendly message and i will private this. (I know its pretty shady to snatch game audio like this but i wanted to preserve it, and also to see what fun bits of dialough were left out)
